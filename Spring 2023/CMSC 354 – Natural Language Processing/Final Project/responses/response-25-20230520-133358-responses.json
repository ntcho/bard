Option B is the safer choice with a guaranteed loss of 450, while option A has a chance of losing more or losing nothing at all.\nAnswer: PREFER_B\n\nSituation 3:\nReasoning: The expected value of option A is higher (500 vs 500), so if one is risk-seeking, they may want to go for the chance at a higher payout.
