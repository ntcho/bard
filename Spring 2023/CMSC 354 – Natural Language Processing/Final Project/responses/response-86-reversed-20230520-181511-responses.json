Situation B, however, has only a coin toss probability of winning 1000. The risk is not worth the reward, as a 50/50 chance equates to an expected win of only 500 in this scenario.\nAnswer: PREFER_A\n\nSituation 2:\nReasoning: In both situations, there is a guaranteed loss. However, in situation B, there is the possibility of losing 1000, which is twice as much as the assured 450 loss in situation A.\nAnswer: PREFER_A\n\nSituation 3:\nReasoning: In situation B, there is a 50/50 chance of winning nothing, which is not a favorable outcome. However, the possibility of winning 1000 outweighs the guaranteed win of 500 in situation A.\nAnswer: PREFER_B\n\nSituation 4:\nReasoning: The guaranteed loss in situation A is the same as the possible loss in situation B. There is no difference in risk for either option.\nAnswer: EITHER\n\nSituation 5:\nReasoning: In situation A, there is a 100% chance of winning 2400. While situation B has a higher chance of winning (66% compared to 33% in situation A), the maximum possible payout is only 2500. Therefore, the higher risk in B is not worth the slightly increased chance of winning less money.\nAnswer: PREFER_A\n\nSituation 6:\nReasoning: Both options have the same maximum possible payout (2400), but in situation B there is a chance of winning nothing. Therefore, the guaranteed 2400 in situation A is a safer bet.\nAnswer: PREFER_A\n\nSituation 7:\nReasoning: In situation A, there is a guaranteed win of 3000. In situation B, there is a higher chance of winning more money (4000), with a slightly increased risk. The potential reward is better in B, so it is the preferred option.\nAnswer: PREFER_B\n\nSituation 8:\nReasoning: In both situations, there is a guaranteed loss.
