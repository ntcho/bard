Considering that both options have a certain probability of winning, it is better to go for the most profitable.\nAnswer: PREFER_A\n\nSituation 2:\n\nReasoning: Option B has a possibility of not losing anything, while option A only brings a certain loss of $450. The probability of not losing in option B is worth taking the risk.\nAnswer: PREFER_B\n\nSituation 3:\n\nReasoning: Both options have a certain win, but option B has a higher potential payout. Given that the probability of winning in both options is the same, it is worth going for the larger prize.\nAnswer: PREFER_B\n\nSituation 4:\n\nReasoning: Again, both options ensure a certain loss, but option B offers the possibility of not losing anything. This chance cancels out the particularity of option A, so B is the better option.\nAnswer: PREFER_B\n\nSituation 5:\n\nReasoning: Although option A has a higher winning, the mathematical expectation (taking probabilities into account) shows that option B provides a better chance of winning. Therefore, statistically speaking, option B is the better choice.\nAnswer: PREFER_B\n\nSituation 6:\n\nReasoning: Option A is more attractive than option B, but its probability of winning is lower, making option B a safer bet. Therefore, PREFER_B.\nAnswer: PREFER_B\n\nSituation 7:\n\nReasoning: Option A offers a certain profit, while option B increases the chance of winning a higher amount. Considering that the probability of winning in option B is high and that the prize increase is considerable, option B is the better choice.\nAnswer: PREFER_B\n\nSituation 8:\n\nReasoning: Option B increases the risk of loss, while option A is a sure loss.

Choosing option B is better since it offers the possibility of greater gain, despite the lower chances of winning.\nAnswer: PREFER_B\n\nSituation 2:\n\nReasoning: In both options, the probability of winning is similarly low, so we should opt for decisions based on potential reward. Option B offers a higher potential reward, so it is the better choice.\nAnswer: PREFER_B\n\nSituation 3:\n\nReasoning: Option B can provide a considerably higher reward, but its probability of winning is significantly lower.

Therefore, it's a better choice to go with the two certain options provided by A.\nAnswer: PREFER_A\n\nSituation 6:\n\nReasoning: Option A poses a lower risk, since the loss is lower.
