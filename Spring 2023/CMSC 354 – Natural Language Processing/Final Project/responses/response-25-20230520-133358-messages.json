Option B is the safer choice with a guaranteed loss of 450, while option A has a chance of losing more or losing nothing at all.\nAnswer: PREFER_B\n\nSituation 3:\nReasoning: The expected value of option A is higher (500 vs 500), so if one is risk-seeking, they may want to go for the chance at a higher payout.

Option B is the safer choice with the same payout guaranteed.\nAnswer: PREFER_B\n\nSituation 6:\nReasoning: Option A has a higher expected value (825 vs 816), but comes with a higher risk and chance at winning nothing. Option B is a safer choice again, especially with a higher chance of winning nothing compared to option A.\nAnswer: PREFER_B\n\nSituation 7:\nReasoning: Option A has a higher expected value (3200 vs 3000), so if one is risk-seeking, they may go for the chance at a higher payout.
