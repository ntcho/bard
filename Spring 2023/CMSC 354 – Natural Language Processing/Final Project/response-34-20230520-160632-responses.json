If the longer tour and the destinations are worth the risk, option A may be preferable. If a one-week tour is sufficient or if the risk is too great, option B may be preferable. \nAnswer: PREFER_A or PREFER_B depending on personal preference.\n\nSituation 8:\nReasoning: The chance of winning in option A is very low, making the expected value (0.05*0) = 0.
